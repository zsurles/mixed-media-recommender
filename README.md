# 🎵🎬🎮 Mixed-Media Recommender

A personalized recommendation tool that suggests movies, TV shows, games, music, or books not just based on what you've liked *within* that category, but based on your entire media taste. If you love *The Hunger Games*, *Laufey*, *Red Dead Redemption 2*, and *Interstellar*, this app will help recommend a TV show that fits your vibe.

## Features
- Combine all media types (games, music, movies, TV, books) into one cohesive recommendation system
- Get recommendations for one media type based on your preferences across *all* media types
- Filter by genre, mood, or themes
- Uses SQL databases for structured media data
- Built with Python (optionally includes R for data visualization)
